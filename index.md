##  What is *MSABrowser* and the aim of this library?
MSABrowser is developed as a new JavaScript tool with an ultimate goal of dynamic and fast visualization of sequence alignments, variations, and annotations. Also, it does not require any installation at any platform such as Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. 

*MSABrowser* is able to import pairwise sequence alignment (PSA) and multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data in FASTA format, and variations and sequence annotations in the format of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). 

For the nucleotides or amino acids that are annotated, one can hover them for triggering a pop-up that shows the details of variations and modifications or any other provided notes for the position. 

## Screenshot

As seen in the figure, there are main parts in *MSABrowser*, which are represented as A, B, C and D.

- A: Annotation part

    It represents the sequence intervals/annotations (such as protein domains) given by users. 
    
- B: Notification part

    It represents the modifications (with red asterisks) and position numbers.
- C: Sequence alignment part

    It represents the alignment data. Here, hovering a nucleotide or amino acid triggers a pop-up for showing the details of notes, annotations.
    
- D: Search/options part

    It enables you to search in the alignment data, download the PSA or MSA as FASTA format and Reset the browser.

##  Requirements and Installation
*MSABrowser* is entirely developed in JavaScript and works on a web browser at any platform including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows systems without any installation.

##  How to use *MSABrowser*?
 - Create a directory and download any example listed below or use CDN (Content Delivery Network) links for required files on your page or clone the repository via Git using following command:
 
    `git clone https://github.com/thekaplanlab/msabrowser.git`

    **CDN Links:**

    - JS: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thekaplanlab/msabrowser/javascript/msabrowser.js](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thekaplanlab/msabrowser/javascript/msabrowser.js)

    - CSS: [https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thekaplanlab/msabrowser/css/style.css](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/thekaplanlab/msabrowser/css/style.css)


    > **NOTES for CDN:**
    > 
    > The CDN is used to minimize delays for fetching the required files (JS, CSS, or others) and for loading web page content in less time. 
    > The links for CDN files should be integrated into `<head> </head>` tags using proper tags `<link type="text/css">` for CSS and `<script>` for JS. To see how it looks at the end, the following example or other case studies might be checked.
    > [Click here to reach MSABrowser basic template to learn how these CDN files are used and to see how a basic example can be done.](https://github.com/thekaplanlab/msabrowser/blob/master/examples/template.html)
    
    <br>
    
    > **NOTES for Custom Styling:**
    > 
    > We develop MSABrowser and implement the features after taking a number of comments about to make user interface and user experience of the tool better.
    > 
    > However, one has always a chance to customize the CSS and JS files according to their needs. As an example, the shadow color of the nucleotides with an alteration might be updated or red asterisk might be converted to another proper sign in blue based on the requirements of the users.    

- Then, place your pairwise or multiple sequence alignment (MSA) result file as **FASTA** format in the folder.

- Afterwards, set your parameters and define the title, specify the annotations such as protein domains and add your variations. 

- It's ready to use and visualize now!

Here is the example use of `annotations` variable.
```
var annotations = [
    {
        source: "SourceName1",
        data: [
            {
                'annotation_id': 'AnnotationID',
                'annotation_name': 'AnnotationName',
                'annotation_external_link': 'https://thekaplanlab.github.io',
                'annotation_start_point': 15,
                'annotation_end_point': 290
            },
            {
                'annotation_id': 'SecondAnnotationID',
                'annotation_name': 'SecondAnnotationName',
                'annotation_external_link': 'https://thekaplanlab.github.io',
                'annotation_start_point': 450,
                'annotation_end_point': 570
            }
        ]
    }, 
    {
        source: "SourceName2",
        data: [
            {
                'annotation_id': 'AnnotationID',
                'annotation_name': 'AnnotationName',
                'annotation_external_link': 'https://thekaplanlab.github.io',
                'annotation_start_point': 25,
                'annotation_end_point': 160
            },
            {
                'annotation_id': 'SecondAnnotationID',
                'annotation_name': 'SecondAnnotationName',
                'annotation_external_link': 'https://thekaplanlab.github.io',
                'annotation_start_point': 250,
                'annotation_end_point': 490
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

**Here is the details for use of `annotations` :**

| Key | Description | Example |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| annotation_id | ID of the annotation/sequence interval to be shown in the annotations bar. | PF00091.25|
| annotation_name | A name of the annotation can be provided. | Tubulin |
| annotation_external_link | The link might be provided for referring the source of the annotation once it is clicked. | https://pfam.xfam.org/family/PF00091.25 |
| annotation_start_point | It refers to starting point of the defined sequence interval. **The dashes/gaps in alignment should not be considered while counting the positions, in other words, the real position/residue number in sequence alone should be entered.**  | `3` should be provided if we start it from `"L"` within such a sequence: "MA---LKER--MA--R" |
| annotation_end_point | It refers to end point of the defined sequence interval. **The dashes/gaps in alignment should not be considered while counting the positions, in other words, the real position/residue number in sequence alone should be entered.**  | `9` should be provided if we start it from `"R"` within such a sequence: "MA---LKER--MA--R" |



###  Adding Variations and Modifications & Example

> You are able to add variations and modifications or any types of notes on the corresponding positions.

**Here is the details for use of `alterations` :**


| Key | Description | Example |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| sequenceIndex | The order of the species in the sequence alignment | 1 |
| position | The (real) position of the amino acid in the protein.* | 5 |
| note | The annotation part for this position. | M->A : Pathogenic and causes a disease with a name of X. |
| source | The source of the information. | Surname et. al (2020) |
| type | *The type of the alteration: Variation or modification* | If it is modficiation, state as `Alteration.Modification`. |



**Here is the example how to add a variation or modification:**
```
var alterations = [
    {
        'sequenceIndex': 2, 
        'position': 5, 
        'note': 'M->A : Pathogenic and causes a disease X', 
        'source': 'Surname et. al (2020)'
    },
]
```

> Here, this variation will be added onto the `5th` position in the sequnce of `2nd` species in the alignment data with a note of "`M->A : Pathogenic and causes a disease with a name of X`" and source of "`Surname et. al (2020)`". 

> In addition, if you state the `type` as `Alteration.Modification` (i.e. post-translational modification), it also will be notified as `red asterisk` in the viewer.

> **NOTE**:
> 
> Also, you might want to add several other HTML tags such as `a`, `div`, `p`, or `img` into the `notes` section of an alteration to provide more detail about your variation or modification. 
> 
> For instance, cross-reference link by adding it within the `note` after changing the link in `href` attribute:
> 
> `<a href="http://thekaplanlab.github.io" target="_blank">For details, visit here</a>`
>
> Moreover, use of other tags (`div`, `p`, and `img` in addition `a`) is provided as an example in the template file. [Please click here to reach MSABrowser basic template to learn how you other HTML tags are used and to see how a basic example can be done.](https://github.com/thekaplanlab/msabrowser/blob/master/examples/template.html)
